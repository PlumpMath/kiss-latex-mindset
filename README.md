kiss-latex-mindset
==================

I looked around for some LaTeX framework but definitely that's not what I'd like: I prefer to keep it simple, stupid so I tried to mingle some bare commands to make an easy-to-understand mindset.

## Should be implemented

 * Conf file precedence;
 * Add rake support just like [this repo](https://github.com/threedaymonk/latex-framework);
 * Any simple idea to automate LaTeX document compositiong.

## How to use it

This repository is almost empty so you can clone it and start working with it without any pull conflicts. Just extract the `kiss-latex-mindset-example` zip file and start tuning it.

Basically, all your data will go in the directory `chapter`. You can create a symbolic link to keep you data well separated.

## Licence

This is a free piece of code, you can fork it as you wish. Feel free to issue pull requests :-)

## Contributors or Examples

 * [threedaymonk](https://github.com/threedaymonk) just gave me the idea.
